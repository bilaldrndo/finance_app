# finance_app

This is an open source project where a full fledged Fintech app for the Millenial and Gen Z will be built.

The Figma Design File can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Wr8HWHHvfbvSPmzbjKgalO/Montra---Expense-Tracker-UI-Kit-(Community)?node-id=223%3A1). 

## Why this exists

This project will showcase my expertise in the Flutter programming language and also be a starting point for others to clone and reuse it in their projects.

I will keep in mind to separate as much code as I can so others can reuse it and implement it.

Still haven't decided which pattern to use (MVP, MVC, MVVM, Bloc), but that will be defined later after the majorityof the UI has been built.

### Next Steps
1. Finish the App UI
2. Make a Node.js Backend
3. Add a MySQL or Postrge Database
4. Connect the API to the app
